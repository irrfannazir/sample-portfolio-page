Naming
    We follow a rule protocol for naming each component in
    website development.

Classes
    > Try to name the classes with properties for minimalized
    changes (Considered this rule only if you are not using Tailwind
    CSS or other frameworks).
    > Number the class with order in html after '-' if there is
    more than one with different properties. Only Continue to
    program html

    not after '-'
